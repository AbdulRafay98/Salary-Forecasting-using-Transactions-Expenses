# Salary-Forecasting-using-Transcations-&-Expenses
## A Data@ANZ Program from ANZ

In the project, I have analyze a bank's customers transaction data to get insights about the uselful attributes that will help in forecasting the salaries of the users. The trained model behavior tells that more data required with variety to better predict the salary.

### EDA
* Analyse transaction dataset with an analysis tool (Tableau).
* Done exploratory analysis of the data and done some preprocessing.
* Gathered interesting overall insights about the data.
* Segmented the dataset by transaction date and time. 
* Visualised transaction volume and spending over the course of an average day or week.

### Predictive Analysis
* Python language is used to code. 
* Annual salaries of each customers are identified using the transaction dataset.
* Explored correlations between annual salary and various customer attributes (e.g. age). 
* Visualised interesting correlations using a scatter plot.
* Built a regression model to predict the annual salary for each customer using the attributes identified in above step.
